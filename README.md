# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Live demo: [kickstarter](https://harmonious-trifle-536d1d.netlify.app/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Name: Kickstarter Clone

## Introduction

Welcome to the Kickstarter Clone project! This web application aims to replicate the core functionality and user experience of the popular crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter.com, using HTML, JS, CSS, React, and Chakra UI.

## About Kickstarter

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is a crowdfunding platform that provides a space for creators to showcase their projects, and for backers to support those projects financially. It has been a catalyst for the success of countless creative endeavors, ranging from innovative tech gadgets to artistic endeavors like films and music albums.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to recreate the key features of Kickstarter, allowing users to:

- **Browse Projects:** Visitors can explore a variety of projects across different categories.
- **Create Projects:** Creators can launch their own campaigns, detailing their project goals and funding needs.
- **Back Projects:** Users can financially support projects they find interesting, often in exchange for exclusive rewards.
- **Project Updates:** Creators can provide updates to their backers, keeping them informed about the project's progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, JS, CSS, React, Chakra UI
- **Backend:** json-server (for mock database during development)
- **Database:** [Insert your chosen database technology here]

...

## Backend

The backend of this project is responsible for handling server-side logic, processing requests from the frontend, and interacting with the database. During development, we use `json-server` as a mock database to simulate backend interactions. In a production environment, you may replace this with a more robust backend solution.

...

## Database

The database is responsible for storing and managing the application's data. During development, we use `json-server` as a mock database. In a production environment, you may replace this with [Insert your chosen database technology here].

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the application: `npm start` or `yarn start`
